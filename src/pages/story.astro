            Hi there, I'm Ritesh ðŸ‘‹
            <br />
            <br />
            I'm a final year Computer Science student at the Bundelkhand University in Jhansi (ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³). I'm a fullstack developer
            with over 2 years of experience crafting mind-blowing
            applications. Web apps, mobile apps, chrome extensions, I've
            conquered them all. No biggie.
            <span class="text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-100 text-base font-bold"
                >JK, I'm still learning!</span
            >
            <br />
            <br />
            You know what they sayâ€”I've been a JS fanboy since day one. React, React Native, Node, Express, Next,... I've danced with them all.
            But that's not all, folks.
            <br />
            <br />
            When it comes to tech, I'm the guy who's always on the hunt for the latest
            and greatest. Trendy tech? You bet I'm curious. I just love exploring
            new stuffsâ€” Backend, Databases, System Design, CI/CD you name
            it.
            <br />
            <br />
            But hey, I'm not all about the code. I'm a fitness enthusiast, sculpting
            my coding muscles while pumping iron at the gym. And don't get me started
            on coffeeâ€”it's the react that fuels my coding adventures. They say knowledge
            is power, and I'm here to soak it all in. An eternal learner, always
            tinkering, experimenting, and solving problems. The tech world is my
            infinite universe, and I'm on an endless quest for discovering new horizons.
